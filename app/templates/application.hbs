{{! There's also a page-title helper call, which was put into the template when Ember CLI generated the project.
 It sets the document title that is shown in the browser tab. }}

{{page-title "Rock & Roll with Octane"}}

{{! PT. 1 }}

{{! Created a quick update to visibly see an idea of what
we are creating on the DOM
 }}
{{! The array helper takes a varying number of arguments and creates an array that 
  contains them.
   }}

{{! The hash helper creates a POJO (Plain Old JavaScript Object) 
  in template-land.
 }}

{{! Putting these together, the song block variable will loop through each 
 object created by the hash helper and render a list item for each of them. }}

{{! <ul> }}
