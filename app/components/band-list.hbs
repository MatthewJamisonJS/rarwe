{{! Notice how we're iterating through this.bands, the property defined in the backing JavaScript class.
It's a great example of how @bands and this.bands refer to two different things in component templates

@bands is an argument that was passed in, while this.bands is a property defined in the JavaScript class.
We now have to invoke the component from the bands template, passing the bands into it
